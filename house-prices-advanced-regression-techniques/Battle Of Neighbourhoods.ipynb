    "Hello, My name is Dhaval Javia and I am from India currently working at Infosys. I was thinking to moving abroad and for that first thing you search for when you reach there is House to stay (Of course Food comes first but for now let's keep the hungar  aside.) So i want house on rent which i can afford, so initially price is the factor for me. After i stabilize in the country, i can go for buying a house so i need some sort of system where i can search and compare house rent prices as per neighborhood.  "
